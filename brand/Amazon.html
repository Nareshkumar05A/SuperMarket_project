            <h2>COVID-19</h2>
            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Amazon faced worker protests at its Staten Island warehouse over unsafe conditions; organizer Chris Smalls was fired after raising concerns. Due to a surge in online shopping, Amazon temporarily paused non-essential third-party shipments, hired around 175,000 workers, and raised wages by $2/hour to manage the demand and labor shortage.</p>
